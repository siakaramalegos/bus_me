## Bus Me
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/siakaramalegos/bus_me.svg?branch=test)](https://travis-ci.org/siakaramalegos/bus_me)

I created this app as a learning project for Tech Talent South's code immersion bootcamp.  It is a Rails app that uses Atlanta's MARTA API to pull in nearest bus information based on a user's inputed location.

You can see the deployed version on [Heroku](https://bus-me.herokuapp.com/).
